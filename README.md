## What Are NFTs?

NFTs, or **Non-Fungible Tokens**, are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible (interchangeable), NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated.

### Key Features of NFTs:
- **Uniqueness**: Each NFT has a distinct value and identity.
- **Ownership**: Provenance is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
- **Interoperability**: NFTs can be traded across various platforms and marketplaces.

3. **AI-Generated Art**: Artists are using AI to create unique digital artworks, which are then minted as NFTs.
